# Cyberinfrastructure Need and Vision

## Current State of Policy Research Infrastructure

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Detailed analysis of existing tools and their limitations]*

Policy research today faces significant cyberinfrastructure challenges that limit scientific discovery and evidence-based decision-making:

### Fragmented and Proprietary Tools
- Most advanced microsimulation models are proprietary (TAXSIM, TRIM, CBO models)
- Open-source alternatives are limited in scope or technically outdated
- No integrated platform combining tax, benefit, and behavioral modeling
- Researchers often build custom tools, leading to duplicated effort and incompatible results

### Scalability and Performance Limitations
- Traditional microsimulation requires extensive computational resources
- Analysis of large populations or complex policy scenarios takes days or weeks
- Limited parallelization and cloud computing integration
- No real-time capabilities for interactive policy exploration

### Reproducibility Crisis
- Policy analysis often lacks transparency and reproducibility
- Proprietary models cannot be audited or validated by independent researchers
- Inconsistent data sources and modeling assumptions across studies
- Limited version control and documentation of policy parameters

### Accessibility Barriers
- Advanced policy analysis requires specialized technical expertise
- High licensing costs exclude many researchers and institutions
- Complex installation and configuration requirements
- Limited documentation and user support resources
