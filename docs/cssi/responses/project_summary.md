## Overview

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - This section should provide a compelling 1-page summary of the entire CSSI Elements proposal]*

PolicyEngine represents a transformative cyberinfrastructure initiative that will establish the world's most comprehensive open-source platform for policy microsimulation and economic research. Building on our successful NSF POSE Phase I foundation, this CSSI Elements project will create scalable, cloud-native infrastructure that enables researchers, policymakers, and educators to conduct sophisticated policy analysis with unprecedented speed, transparency, and accessibility.

## Cyberinfrastructure Innovation

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Highlight the technical innovations and infrastructure gaps being addressed]*

Our proposed infrastructure addresses critical gaps in computational policy research:
- **Scalable Microsimulation Engine**: High-performance computing integration for population-scale modeling
- **Real-Time Policy APIs**: Sub-second response times for interactive policy analysis
- **Federated Data Infrastructure**: Privacy-preserving access to survey microdata across institutions
- **Reproducible Research Platform**: Containerized environments with version-controlled policy parameters

## Research Impact

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Describe the research questions and communities that will be enabled]*

This infrastructure will enable new research frontiers across multiple domains:
- Real-time policy optimization using machine learning techniques
- Cross-national comparative policy analysis with standardized metrics  
- Behavioral microsimulation integrating agent-based modeling
- Dynamic policy impact assessment incorporating temporal effects

## Broader Impacts

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Connect to NSF's broader impacts criteria]*

PolicyEngine cyberinfrastructure will democratize access to advanced policy analysis tools, support evidence-based policymaking, and enhance economic policy education. Our commitment to open-source development and inclusive community building ensures broad accessibility and sustainable impact across diverse user communities.

## Team and Timeline

*[TO BE DEVELOPED - Brief overview of team expertise and 4-year timeline]*

Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in microsimulation modeling, software engineering, and cyberinfrastructure development. Over four years, we will deliver a production-ready platform serving thousands of researchers while establishing sustainable governance and funding models for long-term operation.
