## PolicyEngine as CSSI Infrastructure

PolicyEngine represents a natural fit for CSSI Elements funding, addressing critical cyberinfrastructure needs in policy research and economic analysis.

### Cyberinfrastructure Gaps Addressed

**1. Policy Microsimulation at Scale**
- Current tools are fragmented, proprietary, or limited in scope
- No open-source platform combines tax, benefit, and behavioral modeling
- Lack of cloud-native architecture for large-scale simulations

**2. Reproducible Policy Research**
- Policy analysis often lacks reproducibility and transparency
- Researchers cannot easily replicate or extend existing studies
- No standardized framework for comparing policy alternatives

**3. Cross-Disciplinary Integration**
- Economics, public policy, sociology, and computer science researchers work in silos
- Limited tools for collaborative policy analysis
- Lack of standardized APIs for policy data and calculations

**4. Real-Time Policy Impact Assessment**
- Traditional microsimulation requires specialized expertise and weeks of computation
- Policymakers need rapid feedback on policy alternatives
- No infrastructure for real-time "what-if" policy analysis

### Technical Innovation Areas

**High-Performance Computing Integration**
- Optimize microsimulation algorithms for parallel execution
- Implement distributed computing patterns for population-scale modeling
- Integrate with HPC facilities for computationally intensive analyses

**Advanced Data Infrastructure**
- Federated access to survey microdata with privacy preservation
- Real-time integration of administrative data sources
- Machine learning pipelines for data imputation and synthetic data generation

**Interactive Visualization Platform**
- Real-time rendering of policy impact visualizations
- Interactive dashboards for policy scenario comparison
- Embedded visualization components for research publications

**API-First Architecture**
